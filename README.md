# B213 core rotation project
This project is done in collaboration with yoshito shimajiri and Nagayoshi Ohashi.
The goal is to study the starless core of the Taurus filament B213 to understand 
if the rotation imprinted in protostars is somehow related to the turublence in the cores.
Nagayoshi got ALMA data, mostly TP and ACA of 28 (I believe) star-less fors in B213.
Yoshito already reduced the TP data, so I am supposed to use his developed code
to generate moment maps (zero, one, two, etc.) and eventually PV diagram to check the
velocity gradients in these sources.
Eventually, we want  to have a way of measuring rotation in such cores.
