1. make_TP_maps.py

This code will run the moment creation routines for BTS (Seamus's code). This allows for the creation of nice moment maps.

From this it can compute moment maps (0,1,2) for single sources or for all of them.

This code can also compute the spectra for the different molecules in different formats (single or grid).

2. channel_maps.py

This code will create a channel map for an initial velocity a grid size for a single or all the sources for a given molecule.

3. 2D-spectral_maps.py

We can create spectral maps which are grids of spectra for every single 'pixel'

4. continuum_vs_line_position.py

This one produces moment maps and overlay the continuum position based on Herschel data. This one was a test to see how well aligned were the observations. 

5. Line_fitting_codes.py

This is just a helper function code!
